## Overview
With our AKS Kubernetes cluster in place we're now ready to start using it, we'll do this by creating some Kubernetes *Pods* and *Deployments* via configurations

> **ðŸ“• Kubernetes Glossary.** A *Pod* is a group of one or more containers running in the cluster. For this lab we will deploy single pod containers, although not technically correct for now  you can think of a pod being equivalent to a container.  
A *Deployment* is a logical object representing a set of replicated pods, managed by a *ReplicaSet*. The *Deployment* will manage things such as rolling updates, scaling etc. In general you make changes to *Deployments* and not directly to *Pods*

We have three microservices we need to deploy, and due to dependencies between them we'll start with the **MongoDB** database then the **Data API** and then finally move onto the **Frontend**

We'll apply configurations to Kubernetes using `kubectl` and YAML configuration files. These YAML files will describe the objects we want to create, modify and delete in the cluster. 

To get started create a directory on your local machine (e.g. **C:\Dev\kube-lab**) to hold the files we'll be creating and editing in this lab, and then start VS Code with this empty directory as it's project (File -> Open Folder)

### Cloud Shell Editor
If using the Azure Cloud Shell, it's strongly recommended to use the built-in online editor which is invoked with the command `code .` Note the dot after the command, it's recommended you invoke the editor this way as it will then show a file explorer view for the current directory.

When creating a new file use the touch command to create an empty file, e.g. `touch foo.yaml`, then in the editor click refresh icon at the top of the files view in order to see the file and open it for editing. There are other ways to use the Cloud Shell Editor, but this workflow is recommended 

## Deploy MongoDB 
Create a new file called **mongo.deploy.yaml** and paste the following contents in it:
```yaml
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  name: mongodb
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mongodb
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mongodb
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mongodb-pod
        image: mongo:3.4-jessie
        ports:
        - containerPort: 27017
```

**ðŸ’¬ Note.**  YAML is sensitive to indentation and white space, so be extra mindful of this when copy & pasting

There's a lot going on here but we'll cover of some of the concepts:
- We're declaring a *Deployment* named **mongodb**
- This deployment will create a replicated set of pods (using *ReplicaSet*), however for this MongoDB deployment we'll run just 1 pod
- The *Pod* will run a container from the `mongo:3.4-jessie` image, which will be pulled from Dockerhub. This is the standard official MongoDB image, it is not specific to our Smilr application 
- The container will expose TCP port 27017 out to the *Pod* and the cluster
- We apply label metadata `app=mongodb` which we'll use to help locate the pods later. This labelling is completely up to us, it's just arbitrary key value pairs

To apply this configuration to the cluster we run:
```
kubectl apply -f mongo.deploy.yaml
```
If successful you will see `deployment "mongodb" created`. You can check the status of your cluster with this command (or you can use the dashboard)
```
kubectl get all
```
You should see a deployment called mongo (prefixed **deploy/**) a replica set (prefixed **rs/**) and a pod (prefixed **po/**), the pod and replica set will have auto generated names appended.

Each pod in Kubernetes gets its own IP address within the cluster. If you are interested, it is worth spending 5 minutes reading some of the concepts  
[ðŸ“˜ Kubernetes network concepts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/#kubernetes-model){:target="_blank" class="btn-info"}

To get the pod's IP address run the `describe pod` command with a filter set to our `app=mongodb` label
```
kubectl describe pod -l app=mongodb
```
You can find the IP in the output (it will be a 10.244.x.x address), make a note of it, we'll use it in the next step

**ðŸ’¬ Note.** The kubectl command supports a number of different output formats, including JSON, YAML and a syntax called [JSONPath](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/jsonpath/) which allows you to filter and query the output. So in order to just get the IP address we could also have run:

`kubectl get pod -l app=mongodb -o=jsonpath='{.items[0].status.podIP}{"\n"}'`

## Deploy Data API
Create a new file called **data-api.deploy.yaml** and paste the contents below in it. You will need to replace **{acr_name}** and **{mongo_ip}** with their real values.

If you skipped Part 2 you are not using ACR, then you can omit the registry and just use `smilr/data-api` as the image and remove the `imagePullSecrets:` section
```yaml
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  name: data-api
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: data-api
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: data-api
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: data-api-pod
        image: {acr_name}.azurecr.io/smilr/data-api
        ports:
        - containerPort: 4000
        env:
        - name: MONGO_CONNSTR
          value: mongodb://{mongo_ip}
      imagePullSecrets:
      - name: acr-auth
```

As before, to apply this configuration to the cluster we run:
```
kubectl apply -f data-api.deploy.yaml
```

You can check the status with either the dashboard, or a couple of commands, a basic check is running `kubectl get pods` and check the pod(s) are in **Running** status. However this status can sometimes be misleading.

A better picture can be found using `kubectl logs` to view the stdout & stderr inside the running containers. This view the logs of all our data-api pods (all one of them)
```
kubectl logs -l app=data-api
```
Check the output for log messages confirming the app has connected to MongoDB OK and has started listening on port 4000

## Access Smilr Data API
Now how do we access the Smilr Data API? One quick way is to use port forwarding to create a 'tunnel' into the cluster using `kubectl port-forward`.

First get the name of of the Data API pod with:
```
kubectl get pods
``` 

Then start the port forwarding tunnel from localhost port 8080 to the container port 4000, with: 
```
kubectl port-forward {data_api_pod_name} 8080:4000
```
Now access the Data API in your browser by visiting `http://localhost:8080/api/info` this should return some system & status information from the Smilr API as JSON. You can now use `Ctrl+C` to stop the `kubectl port-forward` command and close the tunnel.

## End of Module 3
What we have have at this stage in Kubernetes can be represented as follows

Now this is not a recommended configuration for a lot of reasons, and in the next module we will examine why, and start to rectify it
