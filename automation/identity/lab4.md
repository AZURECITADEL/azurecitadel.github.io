excerpt: Create a service principal and store the secret

## Introduction

Some text.

## Summary

We have gone through the scripted method to create a service principal and assign a standard built in RBAC role. We have also looked at a couple of different ways to store the secrets.

In the next section we'll look beyond the built in roles and look at how you can create your own custom RBAC role definitions.
