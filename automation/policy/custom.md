---

## Introduction

The number of in built policies and initiatives is vast, and keeps on growing. You will find most use case scenarios have been covered as Azure leverages policies to meet compliancy and regulatory requirements.

However, it is still common to come up against requirements from partners and customers that are not catered for. This is where custom policies come in. This lab will run through a real life requirement I had from a partner.

After the scenario has been described we will run through the basics of the policy structure and make sure you have a good set of links. We'll then step through the process to create the custom policy.

> **Creating custom policies is a dark art and much of the text is to help you understand some of the nuances. Don't just fly through the lab by copying the code blocks out!**

## Pre-reqs

You will need:

* Azure subscription
* Azure CLI
* jq

This lab uses Visual Studio Code, with the [Azure Policy extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AzurePolicy.azurepolicyextension) installed.

It is recommended to read through the documentation for:

* [Azure Policy definition structure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/concepts/definition-structure)
* [Azure Policy extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/how-to/extension-for-vscode)

## Scenario

Before we start, let's spend a little time understanding the scenario that the customer was trying to prevent.

The customer uses Just In Time access (JIT) to minimise the attack surface of their management VMs. When you use JIT, the service creates a rule on the NSG to deny traffic on ports 22 (SSH), 3389 (RDP) and 5985/5986 (WinRM). (This is the default list of ports and can be customised.)

![JIT default](/automation/policy/images/custom-jit-default.png)

When you connect to a protected VM you have the option of using your internet IP address as the source, specifying one or more addresses or allowing any source IP.

![JIT connect](/automation/policy/images/custom-jit-connect.png)

_All configured IPs_ is the current default. If that default is used and accepted then a new rule goes in with a higher priority.

![JIT any](/automation/policy/images/custom-jit-anysourcerule.png)

Note the **Source: Any**. This rule will be automatically removed after a period of time - usually three hours - but in the meantime there is a greater risk of a brute force attack against the public IP.

The customer has asked whether it is possible to use policy to deny any JIT created rules with the _All configured IPs_ option.

Challenge accepted!

## Discovering aliases

In this lab section you will use the vscode extension to create a policy to meet the customer requirement in the scenario above. The lab will highlight the functionality of the extension, as well as understanding how aliases work.

We'll be initally working in Bash before moving to vscode, but feel free to use similar PowerShell commands or the portal as long as you get to the same point.

### Create an NSG

Start by creating an NSG containing an offending rule.

Log into Azure and select the correct subscription before starting.

1. Create a resource group

    ```bash
    az group create --name custom_policy_lab --location uksouth
    ```

1. Create a network security group

    ```bash
    az network nsg create --name offender --resource-group custom_policy_lab --location uksouth
    ```

1. Add a rule similar to the any source JIT rule

    ```bash
    az network nsg rule create --name anysourcerule \
      --nsg-name offender \
      --resource-group custom_policy_lab \
      --direction Inbound \
      --priority 100 \
      --destination-address-prefix 10.0.0.4 \
      --destination-port 22
    ```

    You will now have an NSG with an offending rule that matches those created by JIT.

    ![offending rule](/automation/policy/images/custom-offender-anysourcerule.png)

### Find aliases with the Policy extension

Before creating a custom policy it is important to understand which aliases to use. These will be used as [fields](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/concepts/definition-structure#fields) in the policyRule. We then need to determine the logic we want to create.

The Azure Policy extension in vscode helps to view resources and policies and to discover the right aliases to use in your policy rules, but also be aware that it is a preview extension and does not always include the full set of available aliases.

1. Create a working folder for the lab

    ```bash
    mkdir ~/custom_policy_lab
    ```

1. Open the folder in vscode

    ```bash
    code ~/custom_policy_lab
    ```

1. Open the extension side bar ('CTRL'+'SHIFT'+'E')
1. Click on Azure Policy
    * Install the extension if you haven't done so already
    * Log in to Azure if the toast notification prompts you
    * It takes a couple of minutes to discover your resources and policy information
1. Browse the policy section to view the policies, initiatives and assignments
1. Browse the Resource Groups and click on your NSG

    ![extension](/automation/policy/images/custom-extension-resource.png)

    The resource type is **Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups**.

    The **destinationPortRange** and **sourceAddressPrefix** are the two properties that were populated. We should also check the rule to ensure that the **direction** is _Inbound_ and **access** is _Allow_.

    > NSG rules also allow you to specify either source address prefixes and destination port ranges as arrays, so should we also check the **destinationPortRanges** and **sourceAddressPrefixes** as well to make sure nothing slips through the net?

1. Browse the Resource Providers and drill into Microsoft.Network and then networkSecurityGroups

    * If you click on the offender NSG then you'll see the same resource info as before

1. Hover over the **destinationPortRange** and copy the alias

    ![alias](/automation/policy/images/custom-extension-resourcealias.png)

    * Create a new file called aliases
    * Paste in the alias
    * Repeat the process for **sourceAddressPrefix**

    Your list of aliases from the resource level should be:

    ```json
    Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules[*].destinationPortRange
    Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules[*].sourceAddressPrefix
    ```

1. Hover over the destinationPortRanges and sourceAddressPrefixes arrays

    Note that the vscode extension does not display aliases for these.

    As already mentioned, the extension is in preview and has not yet been updated to include all aliases.

    We will use the CLI soon to pull out all of the available aliases and to understand how they differ.

1. Explore the sub-resource

    * Open the tree for the Resource Providers and you will see securityRules as a sub resource type
    * Click on anysourcerule

    ![alias](/automation/policy/images/custom-extension-subresourcealias.png)

    OK, now we have more aliases that we could use if we are working at the sub resource level.

    ```json
    Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules.destinationPortRange
    Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules.sourceAddressPrefix
    ```

    Many of the more complex resources have sub-resources and the resource provider tree is a great way of finding those.

### Find aliases with the Azure CLI

We'll use the Azure CLI to get a definitive list of the aliases as the vscode extension isn't showing everything. Some of these commands won't be pretty as they are using some complex JMESPATH queries to dig out the information.

> Alternatively you can use the Resource Graph, PowerShell or REST API to query for [aliases](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/concepts/definition-structure#aliases).

1. List the resourceTypes

    We already know that we can look at the resource or sub-resource level. Let's show those:

    ```bash
    az provider show --namespace Microsoft.Network --expand "resourceTypes/aliases" --query "resourceTypes[?starts_with(resourceType, 'networkSecurityGroups')].resourceType" --output yaml
    ```

    Expected output:

    ```yaml
    - networkSecurityGroups
    - networkSecurityGroups/securityRules
    ```

1. You can use the Azure CLI to check for all available aliases.

    OK, let's list out the possible sourceAddress aliases to test where the source address could be set to Any.

    ```bash
    az provider show --namespace Microsoft.Network --expand "resourceTypes/aliases" --query "resourceTypes[?starts_with(resourceType, 'networkSecurityGroups')].{type: resourceType, alias:aliases[?contains(name, 'sourceAddress')].name}" --output yamlc
    ```

    Example output:

    ```yaml
    - alias:
      - Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules[*].sourceAddressPrefix
      - Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules[*].sourceAddressPrefixes[*]
      - Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules[*].sourceAddressPrefixes
      type: networkSecurityGroups
    - alias:
      - Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules/sourceAddressPrefix
      - Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules/sourceAddressPrefixes[*]
      - Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules/sourceAddressPrefixes
      type: networkSecurityGroups/securityRules
    ```

    > (I've removed the defaultSecurityRules as we're ignoring those.)

The set of aliases for destinationPortRange matches the list format above.

## Determine the required logic

OK, lots of options which could result in a very complex policy if were had to deal with all the possible permutations. Having some knowledge of how the Azure Resource Manager works can help reduce that complexity. Let's work through it.

### Which resourceTypes?

We have to test the `networkSecurityGroup/securityRules` resourceType. The JIT process will [create a single security rule](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/virtualnetwork/securityrules/createorupdate) against the existing NSG.

But we should also test the aliases at both the `networkSecurityGroup` resourceType. Our policy should also prevent the [creation or update of an NSG](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/virtualnetwork/networksecuritygroups/createorupdate) with these securityRules within them.

Your rules should always include a `"field": "type"` rule so the system knows which resourceTypes to filter for testing.

```json
{
  "field": "type",
  "equals": "Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules"
}
```

We'll work through the additional test conditions for the `Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules` resourceType before moving on to `Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups`.

### Source Address set to Any?

The **sourceAddressPrefix** property will have a string value. String values are supported by a wide range of [conditions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/concepts/definition-structure#conditions).

We will use `"equals": "*"` to test:

```json
{
  "field": "Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules/sourceAddressPrefix",
  "equals": "*"
}
```

Do we also need to test the sourceAddressPrefixes or sourceAddressPrefixes[*] aliases? The answer is no.

The Azure Resource Manager layer prevents '\*' being combined with other values in a sourceAddressPrefixes range. If you specify sourceAddressPrefixes with '\*' by itself (a single element array) then sourceAddressPrefix will be set to '\*' and sourceAddressPrefixes will be set to an empty array.

Sometimes you have to test a few variants to understand the behaviour.

### Destination Port Ranges?

We need to test that the destination port ranges does not equal any of our Just In Time ports. The most likely are 22 and 3389, although the WinRM ports could also be requested.

The [JIT request API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/securitycenter/jitnetworkaccesspolicies/initiate#initiate-an-action-on-a-jit-network-access-policy) call only allows a single destination port range value to be entered so we can forget the destinationPortRanges and destinationPortRanges[*] aliases and just test the destinationPortRange.

```json
{
  "field": "Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules/destinationPortRange",
  "in": [
    "22",
    "3389",
    "5985",
    "5986"
  ]
}
```

### Logical operators

There are three [logical operators](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/concepts/definition-structure#logical-operators) that you can use when nesting JSON for more complex conditions

* not
* allOf
* anyOf

You can nest _allOf_ within _not_ to create _noneOf_.

At the `networkSecurityGroups/securityRules` resourceType level we need all three conditions to be true, plus the *direction:Inbound* and *access:Allow* properties, so the JSON would look like this:

```json
{
  "allOf": [
    {
      "field": "type",
      "equals": "Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules"
    },
    {
      "field": "Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules/direction",
      "equals": "Inbound"
    },
    {
      "field": "Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules/access",
      "equals": "Allow"
    },
    {
      "field": "Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules/sourceAddressPrefix",
      "equals": "*"
    },
    {
      "field": "Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules/destinationPortRange",
      "in": [
        "22",
        "3389",
        "5985",
        "5986"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

We will use a parameter for that array of ports to make the policy more flexible.

OK, that is the `networkSecurityGroups/securityRules` resourceType done.

### Splat aliases

Now for the `networkSecurityGroups` resourceType. Here are the matching aliases:

* Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules[*].sourceAddressPrefix
* Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules[*].destinationPortRange

There is good documentation to help you [understand the [*] alias](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/concepts/definition-structure#understanding-the--alias). I'll call them splat aliases as they are similar to the splat expressions in Terraform.

With splat aliases there is an implicit loop so that you can use the string evaluators on each iteration. It is worth understanding the effect of the implicit AND between those iterations on the [evaluations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/how-to/author-policies-for-arrays#evaluating-the--alias). Here are a few common variants:

* _All_

    ```json
    {
      "field": "Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules[*].sourceAddressPrefix",
      "equals": "*"
    }
    ```

* _None_

    ```json
    {
      "not": {
        "field": "Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules[*].sourceAddressPrefix",
        "equals": "*"
      }
    }
    ```

* _Any_

    ```json
    {
      "not": {
        "field": "Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules[*].sourceAddressPrefix",
        "notEquals": "*"
      }
    }
    ```

    If you see _not_ and _notEquals_ combined then it will be on a splat alias.

### Count

We will need to do a compound test of all of the conditions whilst cycling through the splat aliases, and we want a _true_ result if any of the security rules in an NSG tick all of the boxes. This is where [count](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/concepts/definition-structure#count) comes in. Count can be used to see how many of the iterations meet the condition criteria, so you can check for _none_ or _all_ or _any_, or for an exact number.

Therefore, here is the JSON for the 'networkSecurityGroups' level.

```json
{
  "allOf": [
    {
      "field": "type",
      "equals": "Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups"
    },
    {
      "count": {
        "field": "Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules[*]",
        "where": {
          "allOf": [
            {
              "field": "Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules[*].direction",
              "equals": "Inbound"
            },
            {
              "field": "Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules[*].access",
              "equals": "Allow"
            },
            {
              "field": "Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules[*].sourceAddressPrefix",
              "equals": "*"
            },
            {
              "field": "Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules[*].destinationPortRange",
              "in": "[parameters('ports')]"
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      "greater": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

## Create a custom policy

OK, you now have all of the building blocks and info to create the policy, plus a selection of links. The lab will start you off with a template and then you can work through the sections to start fleshing it out. It will be more painful than just copying and pasting code blocks, but no-one learns much that way.

> **If you do get stuck then scroll to the [example azurepolicy.json](#example-azurepolicyjson).**

### Policy template

1. Press `CTRL`+`SHIFT`+`E` to open the Explorer
1. Create a new file called _azurepolicy.json_
1. Copy in the [template](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/tutorials/create-custom-policy-definition#compose-the-definition) below:

    ```json
    {
        "properties": {
            "displayName": "<displayName>",
            "description": "<description>",
            "mode": "<mode>",
            "metadata": {
                "version": "0.1.0",
                "category": "categoryName",
                "preview": true
            },
            "parameters": {
                    <parameters>
            },
            "policyRule": {
                "if": {
                    <rule>
                },
                "then": {
                    "effect": "<effect>"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

### Core properties

Customise the *core properties*

1. Update **displayName** to "_Deny JIT requests with source Any_"
1. Update **description** to "_Deny Just In Time (JIT) requests with Any as the source address prefix._"
1. Set **mode** to "_All_"

Indexed mode should only be used when dealing with resources that have tags and locations.

### Metadata

The [metadata](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/concepts/definition-structure#metadata) block is optional but can be very useful. The _version_, _category_ and _preview_ keys are known ad common properties and control where and how the policy is displayed in the portal.

1. Set the **category** to "_Just In Time_"

    You can specify a pre-existing category that is already used by the inbuilt policies, or create a new category.

You can also create your own key value pairs within the metadata block to add information that is useful to you. For instance, you could add a creator name, link back to a source repo or refer back to a change request record.

### Parameters

Using [parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/concepts/definition-structure#parameters) makes your policies more flexible and can reduce the number of custom policies you have to create. Make use of the [strongTypes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/concepts/definition-structure#strongtype) where possible.

1. Add a parameter called _ports_
1. Add a suitable displayname and description
1. Default the parameter to the standard set of Just In Time ports

### Policy Rule

Modify the *policyRule* section to deny JIT security rules that have the source address prefix set to Any.

1. Ensure the **if** handles either the networkSecurityGroups or securityRules resourceTypes
1. Use the _ports_ parameter
1. If the condition is evaluated as _true_ **then** the [effect](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/concepts/effects) should be Deny

### Create the additional files

The convention is to create a set of three files as different commands use either the full azuredeploy.json, or the azurepolicy.parameter.json and azurepolicy.rules.json.

1. Create the additional files using jq

```bash
jq .properties.parameters < azurepolicy.json > azurepolicy.parameters.json
jq .properties.policyRule < azurepolicy.json > azurepolicy.rules.json
```

## Assigning the policy

We'll define and assign the custom policy at the subscription scope to test it out.

1. Determine your subscription scope

    ```bash
    subscriptionId=$(az account show --query id --output tsv)
    ```

1. Create the custom policy definition

    ```bash
    az policy definition create --name jitDenySourceAny \
      --display-name "Deny JIT requests with source Any" \
      --description "Deny Just In Time (JIT) requests with Any as the source address prefix." \
      --metadata version="0.1.0" category="Just In Time" preview=true \
      --mode All \
      --params "@azurepolicy.parameters.json" \
      --rules "@azurepolicy.rules.json" \
      --subscription $subscriptionId
    ```

1. Assign the custom policy

    ```bash
    az policy assignment create --name jitDenySourceAny \
      --display-name "Deny Just In Time requests with All Configured Ports" \
      --policy jitDenySourceAny \
      --scope "/subscriptions/$subscriptionId"
    ```

    > I normally recommend bundling custom policies together into a policy initiative and assigning the initiative instead. That approach is better from a lifecycle management perspective.

If you go back into the portal you can see the [definition](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyMenuBlade/Definitions) (in the new category) and the [assignment](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyMenuBlade/Assignments).

## Test the policy

1. Remove the original rule

    ```bash
    az network nsg rule delete --name anysourcerule --nsg-name offender --resource-group custom_policy_lab
    ```

1. Add it back in

    ```bash
    az network nsg rule create --name anysourcerule \
      --nsg-name offender \
      --resource-group custom_policy_lab \
      --direction Inbound \
      --priority 100 \
      --destination-address-prefix 10.0.0.4 \
      --destination-port 22
    ```

    Example output:

    Resource 'anysourcerule' was disallowed by policy. Policy identifiers: '[{"policyAssignment":{"name":"Deny Just In Time requests with All Configured Ports","id":"/subscriptions/2ca40be1-7e80-4f2b-92f7-06b2123a68cc/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/jitDenySourceAny"},"policyDefinition":{"name":"Deny JIT requests with source Any","id":"/subscriptions/2ca40be1-7e80-4f2b-92f7-06b2123a68cc/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/jitDenySourceAny"}}]'.

## Finishing up

Creating custom policies is thankfully rarer as the number of built in policies grows each days. And there is a growing amount of community content out there too. But if you need to create your own policies then understanding aliases and the policy structure is vital. If you think your new custom policy could be useful to others then why not contribute back?

Next we'll use the deployIfNotExists effect to help automate compliance, using managed identities to remediate our resources.
