## Introduction

This self-paced enablement session will run through a sequence of bite-sized labs that build on each other.

Each lab will always include links to the JSON templates at the start and end so that you may compare your own files and highlight any differences.

It is up to you how far through the labs you need to go.  The labs go through to a level of detail and complexity and leverage a number of the features within the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates that provide the power required for more complicated enterprise Infrastructure as Code deployments.

However the advice would always be to keep it as simple as possible and maximise supportability.  Therefore the recommendation is to stop at the earliest point where you can meet the business requirements.

The comments section has been enabled and feedback is always welcome.

## Pre-requisites

Set up your machine as per the [automation prereqs](./prereqs) page.

Note that you won't need the Terraform or Packer binaries for these labs.

## ARM Snippets

Finally, add the snippets for Azure Resource Manager.

1. Browse to the [snippets file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sam-cogan/azure-xplat-arm-tooling/master/VSCode/armsnippets.json) and copy the contents
    * Click on the file contents to get focus
    * Type `CTRL`+`A` then `CTRL`+`C`
1. In VS Code, go to File -> Preferences -> User Snippets -> JSON
1. Paste in the contents **before the last curly brace**
1. Ensure the JSON file has no syntax errors and save

**ðŸ’¬ Note.** Do not install the third party Azure Resource Manager Snippets extension available in the gallery.  This only has a subset of the snippets that you will find in Sam Cogan's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sam-cogan/azure-xplat-arm-tooling/blob/master/VSCode/armsnippets.json).

If you have done this correctly then the following test should work:

1. Create a new file (`CTRL`+`N`)
1. Save it as _test.json_ (`CTRL`+`S`)
1. Click in the file to get focus
1. Type 'arm' and you should see the Intellisense list appear
1. Hit `ENTER` or `TAB` when _arm!_ is highlighted
1. Save the file (`CTRL`+`S`)

Feel free to delete the resulting test.json file.
