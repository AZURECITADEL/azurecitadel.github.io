## Microsoft Build 2019

We are very lucky to be working in Microsoft as we get early access to some of the good stuff coming your way. We actively join the Private Preview, Elite, Dogfood and Insider programmes to road test the new programs and services and feedback to the product teams.

We also have a number of great events, including Ready, Inspire and Future Decoded.  And over May 6th - 8th we held our premier developer conference, Microsoft Build, over in Seattle.

## Cloud Connect

Some of you that work for Microsoft partners will be aware that we used to run Cloud Connects. These were partner oriented webinar sessions covering a number of Azure areas and the key announcements. 

We understand that the rate of innovation on the platform makes it hard to keep on top of all of the information that is released each week, so the aim of the Cloud Connect is to concentrate on the areas in each of the workloads that we see as being importants.  What are the major announcements? How is it going to change how we provide services in the channel? What is the direction of travel? 

So in the aftermath of Build 2019 we thought it would be a great opportunity to revive the sessions and bring in a few subject matter experts to go through the things that caught their eye and what it means.

## Content

Ben Coleman will compere the session, which will cover:

**What** | **Who**

We'll give our view of the key areas. And there will be plenty of scope for questions so make the most of it!
