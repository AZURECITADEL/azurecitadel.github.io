## Introduction

The [Azure Tips and Tricks](https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/) site is pulled together by Microsoft's own Michael Crump, and is a treasure trove of useful info for those of you working on the platform.

Much like our own site it is a GitPages site, supports community contributions and it has an RSS feed. You can browse by topic area, or the most recent additions, as well as an ever growing number of short [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLasX02E8BPCNCK8Thcxu-Y-XcBUbhFWC).

The tips cover a wide range of things from Azure services to APis and portal tricks.  A good recent example is this tip about working with the [Azure billing and cost management API](https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip213.html).

So take a look at the content and subscribe to that feed!
