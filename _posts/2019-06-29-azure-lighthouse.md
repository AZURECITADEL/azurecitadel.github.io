## Introduction

As mentioned in the last post, one of the most significant announcements at Inspire 2019 for partners was Azure Lighthouse.  This is a huge improvement for partners managing resource for multiple tenants.

Tom Wilde and I will have a host of new content building on the automation and governance labs so that you can automate as much as possible. This will extend to the automating recognition (using [Partner Admin Link](https://aka.ms/partneradminlink)) of the impact and influence that you as partners have within your customer subscriptions.
