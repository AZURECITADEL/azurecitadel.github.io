excerpt: Set of new labs covering a wide range of Azure networking concepts

## Introduction

As you know, the Azure Citadel site is a community site, and whilst many of the contributions are from the Cloud Solution Architects working with partners in the UK, we do welcome contributions from elsewhere within Microsoft and from the wider community.

I am pleased to have another example added to the site today. Binal Shah is one of our Principal CLoud Solution Architects over in California, and is sharing a set of labs that she has road tested with customers who are getting up to speed with core networking functionality in Azure.

## Networking Labs

You will find the links to Binal's repo on our [networking labs](/infra/networking) landing page.

Each of the labs gives a simple example that highlights a specific area, and they are individually a nice manageable size, making it easy to consume. Some of the labs build on the configuration from the preceding lab so it is recommended to take them in order.

They cover both the portal and Azure CLI. You will create vNets and subnets, work with NSGs and UDRs, create transitive vNet peers, hub and spoke topology, deploy an NVA, set up a S2S VPN, plus Virtual WAN and Azure Firewall. The last few aren't covered in our older Virtual Data Centre lab so this definitely fills a gap for this site.

The labs are currently in PDF form, but if they prove popular then we will transpose to native markdown. So let us know what you think in the comments!
