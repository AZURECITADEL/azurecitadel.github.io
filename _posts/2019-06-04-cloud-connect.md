## Intro and links

If you're not sure what a Cloud Connect is then please take a look at the post from the 14th May. Thanks to those of you who joined the call last week and contributed to the Q&A.

For those of you who could not make it then we have a [recording](https://portal.meets4b.com/Join?e=e0ad6ffb-1f2f-415c-8faf-ec75ece5c363)
and [deck](https://aka.ms/cc/may2019) for you.

Current thinking is that we will run another of these a little after Ignite which is in Vegas during July.
