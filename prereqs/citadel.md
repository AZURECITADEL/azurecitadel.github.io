## Introduction

The Azure Citadel site is hosted in GitHub pages.  This allows contributors to  documentation using standard markdown.

Once committed to the main repository then the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) engine takes the markdown and then renders it as the static HTML you see on [Azure Citadel](https://azurecitadel.com).

**Note that the guide is being recreated following the site migration and move from the [Skinny Bones](https://mmistakes.github.io/skinny-bones-jekyll/) theme to the more functional [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme.**

## Content

The new guide will cover the following areas:

* Summary of new features with the Minimal Mistakes theme
* New categorisation and content curators
* Overview of the GitHub workflow
* Cloning the repository locally
* Adding new authors
* Example templates for single pages and multi-page content
* Structuring your content
* Configuring Front Matter
* Markdown basics, including links, images and videos
* Customising the navigation for multi-page content
* Reviewing content before committing and making pull requests
