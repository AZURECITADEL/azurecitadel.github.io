excerpt: An overview of the custom integration between Azure Citadel and Azure Search for indexing of static pages, and allowing users to search the site
---
This guide will run through the custom integration that was created for Azure Citadel to use the Azure Search service to index the site and provide search results to users. Although the solution was specific to this site and Jekyll, the working principals and approach could be reused for integrating any static website with Azure Search

[Azure Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/search/) is a search-as-a-service cloud solution that gives developers APIs and tools for adding a rich search experience over heterogenous content in a range of applications

Using Azure Search with a static site like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) presented several challenges
- Generating site content (Markdown and HTML pages) in generalised a data format Azure Search can consume and index
- Getting said data into Azure Search
- Allowing users to query the search from the site, i.e. creating the frontend

# Solution Components
The solution consists of five main elements:
- Jekyll plugin which outputs JSON
- Azure Pipeline for automation of re-indexing
- Azure Search service
- Search page 'client' written in jQuery & HTML5

## End to End Data Flow
The data flow and interaction between the components is as follows

# Site JSON Generation 
A Liquid template page was created to output the site as a single JSON document, this page resides in `_pages/site.json` with a permalink set to `/site.json` so it outputs to the root of the site. It loops over all pages in the site when the Jekyll build is run. The resulting JSON object is an array of documents in a format ready for Azure Search index to consume. See [Azure Search documentation on the required format of the data](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-import-data-rest-api#request-body)

- The `id` field is created from the page URL (which is unique) and Base64 encoded to remove any strange characters
- The other fields are taken from the page object directly
- The content is placed in a field called `content_md`
- `@search.action` field is an instruction to Azure Search

The source of `_pages/site.json`
```markdown
---
layout: null
permalink: /site.json
---
{% assign content_pages = site.pages | where_exp: "p", "p.path contains '.md'" %}
{ 
  "value": [
    {% for page in content_pages %}
    {
      "@search.action": "mergeOrUpload",
      "id":      "{{ page.url | base64_encode }}",
      "author":  "{{ page.author | join: ', ' }}",
      "tags":    "{{ page.tags | join: ', ' }}",
      "title":   "{{ page.title }}",
      "teaser":  "{{ page.header.teaser }}",
      "url":     "{{ page.url }}",
      "excerpt": "{{ page.excerpt }}",
      "date":    "{{ page.date | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}",
      "content_md": {{ page.content | jsonify }}
    }{% if forloop.last %}{% else %},{% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
    ]
}
```

Here's an example of one element (page) in the array

```json
    {
      "@search.action": "mergeOrUpload",
      "id":      "L2F1dG9tYXRpb24vdGVycmFmb3JtL1RlcnJhZm9ybUVudGVycHJpc2Uv",
      "author":  "Fred Blogs",
      "tags":    "tag1, tag2",
      "title":   "Just An Example",
      "teaser":  "images/teaser/example.png",
      "url":     "/stuff/example/",
      "excerpt": "Short overview of a very boring thing that doesn't exist",
      "date":    "2018-10-29",
      "content_md": "<< REMOVED >>"
    },
```


# Azure Pipelines - Build & Re-index
To keep the index up to date and fresh, some sort of scheduled automation process was required. Azure Pipelines was used for this as it has the ability to run the Jekyll build tasks and is flexible enough to automate the other steps we need.

The automation was done as a single 'Build Pipeline' in Azure Pipelines. The pipeline was defined in YAML and is shown below

```yaml
trigger: none 
pr: none

queue:
  name: Hosted Ubuntu 1604

variables:
  - group: citadel-shared-vars

steps:
- task: UseRubyVersion@0
  displayName: 'Use latest Ruby version'

- script: 'gem install bundler -v 1.17.3'
  displayName: 'Install bundler at version 1.17.3'

- script: 'bundle install'
  displayName: 'Run bundle install'

- script: 'bundle exec jekyll build'
  displayName: 'Run jekyll and build site'

- script: 'curl -v -H "api-key: $(search-admin-key)" -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary "@_site/site.json" -X POST "https://$(search-account).search.windows.net/indexes/$(search-index)/docs/index?api-version=2017-11-11"'
  displayName: 'Push site.json to Azure Search'
```

A summary of pipeline:
- Environmental setup (Ruby and bundler)
- Run `bundle exec jekyll build` to build the site, to default output directory `_site`
- Using curl, call the Azure Search REST API and push our JSON results (site.json) as a single POST

Secrets and other variables are held in Azure Pipelines as a variable group called `citadel-shared-vars`. This variable group was created and pre-populated using the Azure DevOps Portal, so that no secrets or other variable settings needed to be hardcoded into the pipeline.

The pipeline runs on a schedule every 24 hours (and not not on repo pushes/commits as many build pipelines would) and the definition YAML stored in the Git repo that contains the site


# Azure Search Configuration
Azure Search is a powerful search as a service capability available as PaaS within Azure. For our needs the set up was fairly simple, an Azure Search instance (or account) was created on the Free tier using the Azure Portal.

As the Azure Portal experience for managing Azure Search is extremely basic & limited, [the REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/searchservice/) was used to setup and configure the service. [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) was used to provide a nice interface to work with the API.

To assist using the API with Postman, the following can be used:
- [ðŸ’¾ Postman Collection for Azure Search](./Azure Search.postman_collection.json){: .btn .btn--success}  
- [ðŸ’¾ Postman Environment for Azure Search](./Azure Search.postman_environment.json){: .btn .btn--success} 

Simply import into Postman and configure the variables in 'Azure Search' environment

As we call the API directly with the documents to index, we are bypassing certain features of Azure Search such as **data source** and **indexer**, all that is required to be configured is an **index**

## Azure Search - Index
The Azure Search index determines which fields will be searchable and returned when querying, and holds the actual data (at least in index form)

Notes on index fields:
- Custom `id` field used as a key, created by the `site.json` generation template page
- Main searchable fields are `content_md`, `title`, `tags` and `excerpt`
- Other fields marked as retrievable are: `url`, `date`, `author` and `teaser`
- All fields are strings

If you refer back to the example JSON document you will notice the `header` field is in fact not a string but an object with nested fields inside it. As we fetch it as a string, this means we get a small chunk of serialized JSON inside it, however we can easily handle this on the client

Example index JSON:
```json
{  
  "name": "citadel-index",
  "fields": [  
    {  
      "name": "id",
      "key": true,
      "retrievable": true,
      "type": "Edm.String"
    },
    {  
      "name": "content_md",
      "retrievable": false,
      "searchable": true,
      "type": "Edm.String"      
    },
    {  
      "name": "title",
      "retrievable": true,
      "searchable": true,
      "type": "Edm.String"      
    },
    {  
      "name": "tags",
      "retrievable": true,
      "searchable": true,
      "type": "Edm.String"      
    },  
    {  
      "name": "excerpt",
      "retrievable": true,
      "searchable": true,
      "type": "Edm.String"        
    },
    {  
      "name": "url",
      "retrievable": true,
      "searchable": false,
      "type": "Edm.String"        
    },
    {  
      "name": "author",
      "retrievable": true,
      "searchable": false,
      "type": "Edm.String"        
    },
    {  
      "name": "date",
      "retrievable": true,
      "searchable": false,
      "type": "Edm.String"        
    }, 
    {  
      "name": "teaser",
      "retrievable": true,
      "searchable": false,
      "type": "Edm.String"        
    }
  ]
}
```


# Search Page  
To consume or use the search index and actually find results, a client page was created using jQuery. As the site in question is static HTML more modern JavaScript frameworks were deemed to complex to integrate with the site. The search experience is a single query field, and results are fetched & shown in real time as they are typed

The page is very simple, mostly self contained & consists of:
- Search input field bound with *keyup* events (using jQuery)
- Area for results to dynamically be displayed
- Function to call Azure Search query API (using jQuery AJAX), parse results & update the page
- Delay callback function
- Simple spinner to give user feedback on activity

The basic form is the Azure Search query API is used as follows
```http
GET https://${AZURE_SEARCH_ACCOUNT}.search.windows.net/indexes/${AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX}/docs?api-version=2017-11-11&api-key=${AZURE_SEARCH_KEY}&search={QUERY}
```

The delay function prevents us overloading the API with requests, so API calls are only made after the user has stopped typing for 500 milliseconds

The API results are parsed as JSON, and certain fields such as `header` run through `JSON.parse()` as they contain embedded JSON strings for nested objects. The `url` can be used to form a link to the relevant page, and fields such as `header.teaser`, `title`, `excerpt`, `date` & `author` allow for display of meaningful results on the page. The parsed results are pushed back to the page with a dynamic element and jQuery append. 

The source of the page created can [be found in the Citadel GitHub repo](https://github.com/azurecitadel/azurecitadel.github.io/blob/master/_pages/search.html)

For a working demonstration simply click the [search link](/search) on this site's toolbar!
